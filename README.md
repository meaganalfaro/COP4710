# Systems Programming Practice Files

This repository contains various practice files from my **Systems Programming** class. These files cover different concepts and techniques related to systems-level programming, including memory management, concurrency, file I/O, and more.

## Contents

- **Memory Management**
  - `malloc_example.c`: Demonstrates dynamic memory allocation using `malloc`, `realloc`, and `free`.
  - `memory_leak_demo.c`: An example of a program with a memory leak and how to avoid it.

- **File I/O**
  - `file_read_write.c`: Simple implementation of reading from and writing to files using system calls like `read()`, `write()`, and `open()`.
  - `file_descriptor_example.c`: Demonstrates file descriptor management and error handling.

- **Concurrency**
  - `thread_example.c`: A basic example of creating and managing threads using the `pthread` library.
